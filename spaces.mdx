## Understanding Spaces

Spaces in Paperguide serve as containers for your documentation. You create a space for each project or topic to keep content organized. This structure helps teams navigate large document sets easily.

## Creating a New Space

You start by accessing the dashboard. Click the "New Space" button in the top right. Fill in the details to set it up.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Dashboard" icon="home">
    Log in to Paperguide. The dashboard displays your existing spaces.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Creation" icon="plus">
    Select "New Space" from the menu.
    ````javascript
    // Example API call for space creation
    const createSpace = async (name, description) => {
      const response = await fetch('/api/spaces', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ name, description })
      });
      return response.json();
    };
    `````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings" icon="settings">
    Set permissions and add a description. Save to activate the space.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Space Permissions

You control who accesses each space. Assign roles like admin, editor, or viewer to members.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Admin Role" icon="shield">
    Admins manage all aspects including deletions.
    <CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
      ```javascript
      // Grant admin access
      await grantRole(userId, spaceId, 'admin');
      ```
      ```python
      # Grant admin access
      grant_role(user_id, space_id, 'admin')
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Viewer Role" icon="eye">
    Viewers read content but cannot edit.
    Use this for external stakeholders.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Customize notifications for space activities. Integrate with Slack for alerts on changes.

<Expandable title="Advanced Space Features">
  Enable versioning to track edits. Archive old spaces without losing data.

## Best Practices for Spaces

Name spaces descriptively, like "API v2 Documentation". Limit nesting to three levels for usability. Regularly review permissions to maintain security.

You export entire spaces as ZIP files containing all pages. This feature aids in backups or migrations.

| Feature | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Permissions | Role-based access | Enhances security |
| Export | Full space download | Easy backups |
| Search | Global within space | Quick navigation |

Troubleshoot issues by checking the activity log. Contact support for persistent problems.

Spaces form the foundation of your Paperguide experience. Master them to unlock full potential.
